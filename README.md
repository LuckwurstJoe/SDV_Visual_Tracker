Hello everyone.
Since this tracker seems to be discontinued, i started to update it a little bit.
Unfortunately, I don't know much about coding, but I will try to continue the tracker as best as I can.

How to use this tracker-pack:
1) Get Poptracker here: https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker
2) At the top of this page, click on the green "<> Code"-Button and choose "Download ZIP"
3) Put this zip-File into the "packs"-folder of your extracted PopTracker-Directory
4) Choose the pack via the folder icon
5) For Autotracking: Click on the AP Symbol at the top and enter the information, Archipelago provides you.

AT THE MOMENT there's a bug, that the layout won't load. Klick on the Settings-Icon beside the AP icon and click on Ginger Island Tracking On/Off, until the layout is shown.
