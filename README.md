Hello everyone.
Since this tracker seems to be discontinued, i started to update it a little bit.
Unfortunately, I don't know much about coding, but I will try to continue the tracker as best as I can.

How to use this pack:
1) Get PopTracker from here: https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker
2) Download this tracker pack (click on the green "<> Code"-button at the top of this site and choose "Download ZIP"
3) Put the downloaded zip-file into the "packs"-folder of the extracted PopTracker Directory
4) Open Poptracker and choose the pack (folder-button to the top of Poptracker)
5) You can enable autotracking via the AP button. Just insert the information provided by your Archipelago Room
6) Have fun
